          <p><span id="drop">F</span>or the past 20 years, Asiaha Butler has lived in Chicago’s Englewood neighborhood, an area many consider to be one of the most dangerous parts of the city. But she doesn’t pay attention to crime rates.

        </p><p>“This is the only time in my life I’ve seen the news report so much on violence,” she said. “It was happening in the ‘90s and the early 2000s, but it wasn’t being reported on. And I’ve talked to journalists before who actually never came to Englewood to report on violence, whereas today they wait around in the community for gunshots.”

        </p><p>As politicians begin to form agendas for the new term, cracking down on crime has become central. Although crime has decreased in Chicago, the city has retained its reputation of “the murder capital of the United States” in both politics and the media. However, residents and experts question whether that label is fair.

        </p><p>The reputation was supported by the FBI’s crime report in 2012, which listed Chicago as having more homicides than any other city in the county. That year, Chicago had 500 murders. Yet, there were almost twice as many murders, 936, in Chicago 20 years prior.

        </p><p><strong><span style = "font-family: Special Elite; font-size: 24px; color: red;">MISINFORMED PERCEPTIONS</span></strong>

        </p><p>Drew DeSilver, a senior writer for the Pew Research Center, said people’s perceptions of crime have rarely aligned with crime rates.

        </p><p>“Crime has gone down significantly the last couple of decades,” he said. “But for the longest time when we asked people how bad crime was, people thought crime was a much bigger problem than it was. Once perceptions are set, they’re very hard to change, even in the face of contradictory data.”

        </p><p>DeSilver found murder rates are much higher in smaller cities than in larger ones such as Chicago. When adjusting for population, DeSilver found, Chicago ranked 21st for the numbers of murder per 100,000 people.

        </p><p>The perceptions of Chicago residents are exactly what Mayor Rahm Emanuel is concerned about, he told POLITICO. Emanuel said the media only focuses on individual incidents of crime and fails to provide the big picture of crime in Chicago.

        </p><p>“When it comes to the perception, the job of the media is to kind of lift the fog,” he said.

        </p><p>Yet, Dick Simpson, a political science professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago, said that although Chicago may not be the murder capital of the country, the expression may actually be beneficial.

        </p><p>“Even if it’s not 100% accurate, if it helps draw attention to the problem and helps focus the resources necessary to solve it, it’s fine with me.” he said. “It’s probably not academically correct, but if it’s correct in terms of getting better policies, it’s good enough.”

        </p><p>Tracy Siska, executive director of the Chicago Justice Project, said crime statistics are “never” accurately portrayed. Rather, politicians use crime rates as a way to instill fear in their constituents.

        </p><p>“One incident… is exploited by the politicians, and then the press picks up and they exploit it, as if the police are supposed to prevent every single crime, as if a safe community never experiences any crime,” he said. “That’s not a reality. We all know it, but we’re not talking about logic. We’re talking about exploiting people through their fears.”

        </p><p>In fact, the Pew Research Center found most Americans are unaware gun crime has drastically decreased over the last two years. According to a Pew Research Center survey, 56 percent of Americans believe gun crime is higher than it was 20 years ago.

        </p><p><strong><span style = "font-family: Special Elite; font-size: 24px; color: red;">‘THE POLITICIZATION OF CRIME’</span></strong>

        </p><p>Politicians have capitalized on these perceptions in order to rally support during election seasons. For example, in this year’s Illinois gubernatorial election, Governor-elect Bruce Rauner, the Republican challenger, harped on outgoing Gov. Pat Quinn’s failure to adequately address the issue of crime.

        </p><p>“We have rampant crime in our neighborhoods, violent crime that is putting families in Illinois, families in Chicago at fundamental risk,” Rauner said in September. “And Pat Quinn has failed on violent crime. He’s created an environment where it can thrive.”
        Arthur Lurigio, a professor of psychology and criminal justice at Loyola University Chicago, calls it “the politicization of crime.” He said during election cycles, politicians try to convince voters they are tougher on crime than their opponents.

          </div>

      </p><p>“What politicians can do is pass laws, set policies and make speeches that can influence the way the laws are enforced,” he said. “Whether they are really doing things to change the [behavior of] people that commit crimes, I would say ‘No.’”

      </p><p>Tom McDonagh, a field representative for the Fraternal Order of Police and an active police officer, said politicians often try to take credit for lower crime rates even though their policies do little to impact them.

      </p><p>“I don’t believe much of what politicians say,” he said. “They have their own agenda. Our agenda is serving and protecting.”

      </p><p>The Chicago Police Department declined to comment.

      </p><p>Siska said police don’t prevent crimes because that’s “not what America wants or needs.”

      </p><p>“Americans don’t want a preventative police force because they don’t want a guy with a machine gun sitting around on every corner,” he said. “When you get into preventative, you get into stop-and-frisk and racial stereotypes. We’re set up to be reactionary, and it’s not a bad thing.”

      </p><p><strong><span style = "font-family: Special Elite; font-size: 24px; color: red;">EFFORTS FOR REFORM</span></strong>

          </p><p>In an attempt to reduce the 2012 murder rate, Chicago paid police officers approximately $103 million in overtime in 2013, with some officers receiving more overtime pay than salary. The 2013 murder total dropped to 414 from the 2012 total of 500, according to the FBI’s 2013 crime report.

          </p><p>However, Simpson, the political science professor, said paying officer overtime is not a longterm solution. He said overtime can be useful for short term problems, but it is ineffective as a solution to a long term problem like crime.

          </p><p>Butler, the Englewood resident, said the increased police presence in her neighborhood did not make residents feel more secure, despite the reduced homicide count.

          </p><p>“In the summer we had all these bikes – cops on bikes, cops walking, cops all over our block and just in Englewood in general,” she said. “People didn’t feel safe that they were around because they don’t speak and engage with the community.”

          </p><p>Yet, McDonagh, the active police officer, say more cops on the streets only makes the city safer. He also said officers are trained to engage with residents in a respectful way.

          </p><p>“If there are too many cops on the street and someone has an issue, I have an issue with that,” he said. “I don’t think you can have too many cops on the street.”</p>
