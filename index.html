              or the past 20 years, Asiaha Butler has lived in Chicago’s
              Englewood neighborhood, an area many consider to be one of the
              most dangerous parts of the city. But she doesn’t pay attention
              to crime rates.</p><p>

              “This is the only time in my life I’ve seen the news report so
              much on violence,” she said. “It was happening in the ‘90s and
              the early 2000s, but it wasn’t being reported on. And I’ve talked
              to journalists before who actually never came to Englewood to
              report on violence, whereas today they wait around in the
              community for gunshots.”</p><p>

              On the heels of the midterm elections and as politicians begin to
              form agendas for the new term, a focus to crack down on crime has
              emerged.  And although crime has decreased in Chicago, the city
              has retained its reputation of “the murder capital of the world”
              in both politics and the media. But is that label still fair?</p><p>

              In 2012, the FBI published its annual “Crime in the United States”
              report, which listed that 500 murders, more than 13,000 robberies,
              more than 12,000 aggravated assaults and more than 112,000
              property crimes occurred in Chicago that year. However, there
              were almost twice as many murders, 936, in Chicago 20 years prior,
              according to the Chicago Tribune.</p><p>

              In an attempt to reduce the 2012 murder rate, Chicago paid police
              officers approximately $103 million in overtime in 2013, with some
              officers receiving more overtime pay than salary, according to the
              Chicago Sun-Times. And the 2013 murder total accordingly dropped
              to 414 from the 2012 total of 500, according to the FBI’s 2013
              crime report.</p><p>

              But Butler said the increased police presence in her neighborhood
              did not make Englewood residents feel more secure, in spite of
              the reduced homicide count.</p><p>

              “In the summer we had all these bikes – cops on bikes, cops
              walking, cops all over our block and just in Englewood in
              general,” she said. “People didn’t feel safe that they were
              around because they don’t speak and engage with the community.”</p><p>

              Drew DeSilver, a senior writer for the Pew Research Center, said
              people’s perceptions of crime have rarely aligned with crime rates.</p><p>

              “Crime has gone down significantly the last couple of decades,”
              he said. “But for the longest time when we asked people how bad
              crime was, people thought crime was a much bigger problem than it
              was. Once perceptions are set, they’re very hard to change, even
              in the face of contradictory data.”</p><p>

              Politicians have capitalized on these perceptions in order to
              rally support during election periods. For example, in this year’s
              Illinois gubernatorial election, Republican candidate Bruce Rauner
              harped on Gov. Pat Quinn’s failure to adequately address the issue
              of crime.</p><p>

              “We have rampant crime in our neighborhoods, violent crime that
              is putting families in Illinois, families in Chicago at
              fundamental risk,” Rauner said, according to the Chicago Tribune.
              “And Pat Quinn has failed on violent crime. He’s created an
              environment where it can thrive.”</p><p>

              Arthur Lurigio, a professor of psychology and criminal justice at
              Loyola University Chicago, calls it “the politicization of crime.”
              He said during election cycles, politicians try to convince voters
              they are tougher on crime than their opponents.</p>

              <!--This is where our final video story will go-->
              <div id = "video_story">
                  <video controls style = "width: 1000px; margin-left: -100px;">
                    <source src = "Englewood_Roll.mp4" type = "video/mp4">
                  </video>
              </div>

              <p>“What politicians can do is pass laws, set policies and make
              speeches that can influence the way the laws are enforced.” he
              said. “Whether they are really doing things to change the people
              that commit crimes behavior, I would say no.”</p><p>

              Lurigio said the most telling way to assess politicians’ knowledge
              of crime is by their approach to solving the issue.</p><p>

              “The politicians who are well versed on the crime issue are
              talking more about keeping people out of the criminal justice
              system,” he said. “They are talking about diversionary programs,
              especially people who have been convicted of low-level drug
              sentences instead of going to prison.”</p><p>

              Butler echoed the necessity for politicians and community
              activists to dedicate more resources to crime prevention rather
              than punishment. She co-founded the Resident Association of
              Greater Englewood, an activist organization that works to reorient
              the largely negative perception of Englewood.</p><p>

              “When I think about, for example, a school, you have A students
              and you have F students,” Butler said. “But then the majority are
              these C [students], average individuals. No one’s paying attention
              to that bigger group, and I feel like all the attention [goes] to
              these people who are terrorizing the community.”</p><p>

              The result of politicians exaggerating the issue of crime, experts
              say, is an ineffective system of enforcement.</p><p>

              “By locking up 2.2 million people,” Lurigio said, “you are keeping
              them out of circulation, but they are eventually released and then
              their lives are much worse off than before they went to prison.”</p>
